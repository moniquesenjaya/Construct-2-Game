In this project, we created a typing game aimed to 5-8 years old to learn how to type and also develop three essentials early skills:
1. Alphabets
2. Numbers
3. Colours

How to play :
In each level , the player needs to type the word according to the animal shown on the screen. When the player typed the right letter(consonants and vowels) , the letter will highlight the word and will automatically proceed to the next level. This goes the same for numbers, alphabets and colours.
Scoring In each stage of the game, the player will earn 10 points, with a total of 100 points after a game is finished. There will be 10 levels in each of the mini-games.

Player Controls:
Keyboard allow user input to play the game (type) Mouse allow user to navigate the menus, homepage and interact with the buttons, adjusts the volume, redirect them to other game modes after finishing one of the game
